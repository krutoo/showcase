# Example of using `@krutoo/showcase` with Vite

This package contains example of documentation built with `@krutoo/showcase` and Vite.

`@krutoo/showcase` is a simple alternative for Storybook that works with every bundler.

## Installation

```shell
npm add @krutoo/showcase
```

## Configuration

#### 0. Basics

You can configure Vite to handle all you will use in stories as you wish, for example:

- TypeScript and JSX
- CSS and CSS-modules
- Raw import (import source code as string)
- MDX import

#### 1. Entrypoint

Use `emitStoriesEntrypoint` to emit entrypoint with all found stories

You can provide next settings:

- `filename` - where will be placed entry file
- `storiesGlob` - glob pattern to find stories
- `storiesRootDir` - root directory where all stories placed
- `rawImport` - how to import raw story content

```js
// @todo
```

#### 2. Bundle entries

You need two provide two entries:

- for story sandbox
- for showcase SPA

You also need to emit two HTML files

```js
// @todo
```

## Defining stories

Create file that matches story pattern in your build config. In this file you need to export `meta` and `default`.

```jsx
export const meta = {
  title: 'My first story',
};

export default function Story() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

If you set up MDX you can add MDX-stories:

```mdx
export const meta = {
  title: 'My first MDX story',
};

# Hello, world

This is **first** MDX-document in my showcase
```
