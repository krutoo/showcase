# `@krutoo/showcase` + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get `@krutoo/showcase` working in Vite.

## Usage

First of all you need to build `@krutoo/showcase` in **repo root**:

```shell
# install deps
npm i

# build && pack
npm run build && npm pack
```

Now in this example folder you need to run:

```shell
# install deps
npm i

# install local version of `@krutoo/showcase`
npm run preparing

# run locally
npm run dev
```
